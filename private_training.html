            <h4>One to One coaching</h4>
            <p>
                All plans start with an initial consultation followed by an initial one month commitment if everything is to your liking. After which, you will have the option to adapt, tweak and personalise your option and make longer commitments to save money. 
                <br>
                One to one coaching is ideal if you work best when working with someone, someone to hold you accountable and to su[pport you through the tough moments. You can work with me personally at an outdoor location or at your preferred gym/studio or even at your house (location dependent).
                We will discover what excites you, what you enjoy while also smashing your fitness goals and improving your wellbeing.

            <h4>Remote Training</h4>
            <p>
                All plans start with an initial consultation followed by an initial one month commitment if everything is to your liking. After which, you will have the option to adapt, tweak and personalise your option and make longer commitments to save money. 
                
                Remote training is ideal if you have a very busy schedule which maybe doesn't allow you to get to a gym/workout area consistently but you still want to have all the benefits a personal trainer brings. These sessions can be changed on a weekly basis to allow for your schedule and you can train from home or a gym that easy accesible for you.
