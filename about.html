        <h3>What my clients say:</h3>
        <p>
            I really enjoy my sessions with Paul, he's calm, cool and collected and listens to what I want from a personal training experience. He's really encouraging and doesn't make you feel bad at the start of your journey, he recognises that we all start from different starting points and helped me a lot in sticking to my routine.

            Joining the group classes with Paul were the best decision I made when I first arrived in Madrid. It allowed me to meet a fun international group, make friends, practice my awful spanish in a fun active environment and all the while receiving top class coaching from one of the best personal traininers in the city. 100% reccommended.

            I started the remote training with Paul during the first lockdown and I must say looking forward to our online sessions were one of the things that kept me sane during that time! Paul would meet with me online twice a week, once for a home training session and once for a summary of how the week went, analysing activity and diet and having him as a support during such a difficult time allowed me to stay positive, active and upbeat.

    <!-- Training philosophy -->
    <div>
        <h3>My Training philosophy</h3>
        <p>My idea of training is "We were built to do this, we were designed to move and there are only positive effects from being active". 
            Unfortunately, the rhythm, distraction, obligations, and stress of modern life present lots of obstacles for people being active. 
            My speciality is helping people see the worth and importance in being active and helping them to realise their potential. 
            Unlocking this potenital can affect all aspects of their lives, giving a renewed sense of self worth, contributing to their mental and physical well-being, 
            through practicing resilience, planning and achieving goals and objectives and being social while doing so. I believe that true growth comes from the difficult moments in life and when we start to embrace these tough moments,
            when we struggle, when we try and try again, we become stronger both physically and mentally from it. Being the best you can be requires a lifetime of practice, 
            commitment to yourself and others and many failures along the way, but it's through this process that many of us see our true identities.

        <h3>My message</h3>
        <p>
            After 20+ years of being active (but not neccessarily always healthy) I feel like I have developed a deep understanding of the key barriers to an active healthy lifestyle as well
            as some of the major motivators to help people make a change. My goal is to help people realise their potential and to do so I think it's importnat tht people understand that we all start from different places. 
            From 10-16 years old when I was a little chubby kid trying to keep up with the stronger and faster kids in football, basketball, athletics and our national game Gaelic Football, I always wished of 
            being in better shape however, lacked the knowledge, understanding and guidance to do so. The more people I spoke to, the more questions I asked and the more I learned from teachers, role models and eventually lecturers and peers, the fitter I seemd to become.
            Small changes over time allowed me to achieve my fitness goals, become better at my chosen sports, feel healthier and happier. I then decided to study "Sports and recreation" and the rest as they say is history.
            Nobody ever starts out living a fantastically healthy lifestyle and stays like that forever, life has many ups and downs and it is a long journey for us all but it's important to remember that
            you can be in the best shape of your life at any age. All it takes is making a decision and reaching out for help to get started.

        <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>

            As expected- almost all types of physical movement. Specifically I love basketball, football, yoga, weight training, tennis, padel, surf, snowboarding, skateboarding (which I just took up aged 35!)
            Music- I love listening to music at all times and love to have a soundtrack for any and all activities. Anyone who knows me knows my favourites are funk and disco. 
            Listening to podcasts- I love to zone out to all types of sports podcasts, history, things you should know, current affairs, whatever! 
            Documentaries - I love sitting down at the end of a long day to some David Attenborough or Brian Cox.
            Brain training apps- as boring as they sound I love testing myself in different ways and improving weaknesses.
            Travelling- Whenever we have the chance my fiance and I love to get away and explore the Spanish country and beyond- we are blessed to live in such a fantastic continent with so much rich history everywhere.
